### Q.2 
**Data Analysis**: 

- Fog is a seasonal phenomenon in North India. It disrupts normal life during winter months. Fog is estimated based on visibility measurements. Given a half-hourly time-series of visibility data, write a program to do the following -

    * Plot the time series of visibility data and save the figure as a file.
    * Estimate the mean and standard deviation of fog for each month, and show the result using a graph.
    
- A fog event begins when the visibility falls below 1 km and ends when it exceeds 1 km. For the given data,
    (a) identify the number of fog-events
    (b) calculate the duration of each fog-event.
- Test Data:
* Five years of visibility data for a site is attached. Analyze the data to answer the following questions. Plot graphs or tables to support your answer.
**Q1**. Which months are likely to have fog?
**Q2**. What is the usual time in a day for a fog event to start?
**Q3**. What is the usual (average) duration of a fog event?
**Q4**. The number of fog events at the site has increased or decreased during the last five years.
